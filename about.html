 <p>Welcome to Extra Ball, a site meant to help you learn and improve your pinball game. I’ve been playing pinball since 2018, and it has been a great way to have fun, meet and hang out with friends, and if you have a competitive spirit – to challenge yourself. 
 
  When I first started playing, wow, I had no idea what I was doing and was pretty terrible (and probably not much better these days). I learned some of the basics, such as how to start a game, how to play multiplayer games and fundamental flipper skills from friends and very nice pinball regulars. It took A WHILE though, and I mean several months, to even feel comfortable approaching and playing a game with the slightest hint of confidence. Fast forward 12 months and I feel comfortable on most games and even know in-depth rules for several games. Although knowing the rules for several games means I only know in-depth rules for 5-10% of pinball games out in the wild. That’s where Extra Ball comes in. I want to provide a resource for the completely new to the experienced player on how to get started, improve your play and various strategies and tips for as many games as possible.
