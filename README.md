# Extra Ball Project
## I really like arcade games, like pinball and killer queen

So I wanted to create a quick "how to" information site for commonly encountered pinball games using bootstrap cards. 
A couple thoughts about the project:
* there are lots and lots of pinball games
* it would be challenging to become rules expert on all of them
* picked games I have local access to and enjoy playing as the starting list
* wanted to keep the tips and pointers short, not a lengthy tutorial
